# Brew-day screen, layout B: what it would take to build

This folder is a proposal. Nothing in it changes CraftBeerPi, and nothing is committed.

- `compare.html` flips between the two layouts Scott compared (press Space). Use it to check either design
  on a monitor, a laptop or a phone, in five moments of a brew day.
- `brew-day.html` is layout B on its own: Scott chose it on 9 Nov 2026. Add `?layout=a` to see layout A. It has
  a sixth moment, `#sparge`, for the runoff to the boil kettle, and a seventh, `#boilpower`, for the boil
  power control Scott asked to have back on 10 Nov. It shows a temperature graph in each
  faceplate, which Scott chose on 10 Nov; add `?graphs=none` to see the screen as first built.
- The pages run on demo data copied from the simulator's config (`C:\src\personal\cbpi-testbench\config`).
  They do not talk to CraftBeerPi. Buttons respond and timers run, but nothing is sent anywhere.

## The short version

Almost all of this is one new React screen in `cbpi4gui`. It can run on today's server, with one exception:
Scott wants one rest timer shared by the monitor and the phone, and only the server can keep that. Every
other reading and command it needs already exists. Which kettle is which, and which switch is which pump,
comes from CraftBeerPi's own kettle settings, so there is no separate file to keep in step. Three more
extras would be better with server work; they are marked "server, optional" and the screen works without
them.

The temperature graphs Scott chose on 10 Nov follow the same pattern. Their temperature line works on today's
server. For the target and element-power lines to reach back before the screen was opened, the
`PID_LOGGING` setting has to be on; heating by hand and the step tags need small server changes to do the
same. The section at the end has the detail.

## Change by change

| Change | What it needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| A fixed brew-day screen: recipe on the left, three faceplates across the top, line drawing of the rig below, screen tabs along the top (bottom on a phone) | React UI | A new view in `cbpi4gui`. The free-form dashboard and its editor stay for other uses. |
| Say which kettle is the HLT, mash tun and boil kettle, which switches are the two elements and the two pumps, and which switch has its own override | React UI and one setting | As built by Brett (9 Nov): no mapping file. The screen reads it from CraftBeerPi's own settings, the way the kettle logics do: the mash tun is `MASH_TUN` or the kettle running PID_HERMS; the boil kettle is `BoilKettle`; the HLT is PID_HERMS's `HLT_Kettle`, or else the kettle whose sensor is its `HLT_Sensor`; the elements are those kettles' heaters and the pumps their agitators. A separate mapping could disagree with what the logics actually drive and lock or label the wrong switch. The override is one new setting, `BREWDAY_OVERRIDE_ACTOR` (an actor picker in Settings). On the rig this gives `HLT_HEAT` (GPIO 6), `BK_HEAT` (GPIO 5), `Recirc_PUMP` (GPIO 7, the override) and `Wort PUMP` (GPIO 8). |
| Faceplates: big red PV over smaller green SV, plus OUT (element power) and MODE | React UI | All from existing data: sensor value, kettle `target_temp`, actor power, whether the kettle logic is running. |
| "SV set by the mash tun" and the locked HLT buttons while the mash tun's HERMS logic runs | React UI | Read from the kettle config the screen already loads: `PID_HERMS` names its heater (`HLT Heater`) and its pump (`Mash Pump`). Write it as a general rule ("a running kettle logic drives its own heater and pump"), not as a special case. |
| Lamp-strip buttons that say their state in words: HEATING, RUNNING, OFF, DID NOT STOP; at least 56 px tall | React UI | Fixes defects U2 (small, adjacent buttons) and U3 (on and off shown mainly by colour). |
| Hold for one second to turn heat on, to switch a kettle to AUTO, and to start the recipe; one tap to turn anything off | React UI | Fixes U2 (one mis-tap can start a heating element). Works with a mouse, touch and the keyboard (Space or Enter held). |
| Every command answers at its own button: "switching on…", then confirmed, or a red "did not stop, tap to try again" plus an alert in the title bar | React UI | Fixes U1 (failed commands are invisible). Actor on and off already return 500 when they fail. The UI must stop throwing errors away and must time out a command that gets no answer. |
| Error messages a person can read | Server, optional | Today most failures come back as a bare 500 or 204. A short reason in the response would let the alert say why. |
| Separate AUTO and MANUAL buttons | React UI | Use the existing `POST /kettle/{id}/on` and `/off`. Do not use `/toggle`: on a screen that is a few seconds out of date, toggle can switch the wrong way. |
| Target editor: −1, −0.1, +0.1, +1 or type a value, then SET | React UI | Existing `POST /kettle/{id}/target_temp`. |
| Boil power beside the boil element: BOIL POWER 45 % in AUTO, POWER 100 % (the element's own level) in MANUAL; tap, adjust, SET; works while a recipe runs | React UI | Scott's top priority, 10 Nov. Existing `set_boil_power` kettle action and `/actor/{id}/set_power`. See "Boil power" below. |
| Recipe column: every step, the current step's time left and progress bar, hop additions with "add now" when due | React UI | Existing step data. Boil additions are already there, for example `Hop_1: 60` and `Hop_1_text: "3.00 oz Centennial"`. Start, Stop and Next step use the existing `/step2/start`, `/step2/stop` and `/step2/next`. |
| Next step asks once, in place: "Skip the rest of Saccharification (23:41 left) and start Sparge?" | React UI | |
| Hop and lid alerts in the title bar with their own button (ADDED, DONE) | React UI | Existing notifications with actions. Since the S2 fix they stay until answered. |
| Line drawing of the rig: liquor and wort pipes that move only while their pump runs; elements glow while heating | React UI | A new drawing component driven by actor state. The 3-vessel HERMS plumbing is built in; the mapping above says which switch is which pump. |
| The drawing's hand valves and which way the liquid goes: through the HERMS coil and round the HLT while mashing; to the boil kettle, with sparge water from the HLT pump to the top of the mash tun, during the runoff | React UI | Scott's request and answers (9 Nov): see the end of this file. CraftBeerPi can't see the valves, so the screen works the positions out from the recipe and says so under the boil kettle ("VALVES ARE SET BY HAND · SHOWN FOR STEP 4 (SPARGE)"). The runoff runs from the moment the step named for it has started (status A, S or D) until the boil step leaves I, so it includes the hold at "Ready to boil?". The step is found the way the core finds it for the first-wort reminder, `StepController._collects_wort`: not a HeatStep; the name, split at camel case, lower-cased and with anything but letters and digits turned to spaces, matches `^(?:step \d+ )?(?:(?:start\|begin) )?(?:(?:fly\|batch\|continuous) )?(?:sparge\|sparging\|lauter\|lautering\|run ?off)(?: \|$)` and contains none of the words water, heat, heating, prepare, preparation, salts or treatment. The boil step is the first BoilStep after it. At any other time, and with no recipe, the drawing shows recirculating. In Test Recipe v5 the Sparge step keeps the mash tun in AUTO, so CraftBeerPi reports the wort pump running "for the HERMS"; during the runoff the drawing still sends it to the boil kettle and leaves the coil dark. The mockup's `runoffStep()` and `renderRig()` are the reference, and `#sparge` is the demo moment. |
| Phone layout: current step on top, faceplates stacked, recipe below, tabs along the bottom | React UI | Fixes U4 (the dashboard does not adapt to small screens). The phone keeps every control the monitor has. |
| Connection lost: readings turn grey and show their age, controls pause, an alert says what is happening | React UI | Uses the websocket's connection state. Reconnecting cleanly is the separate open defect HC-UI-02. |
| ALL OFF in the title bar: recipe stopped, every kettle to MANUAL, both elements and both pumps off | React UI, or server optional | Scott kept it on 9 Nov and asked for it to stop the HLT pump too, so it was renamed from ALL HEAT OFF. The UI can send the separate commands and report any that fail: stop the recipe first (`/step2/stop`) so it can't switch a kettle back on, then each kettle's `/off`, then `/off` for all four switches. A single server endpoint would make it one command that either works or fails as a whole. The HLT pump's override switch can still run that pump; see the next row. |
| The HLT pump's override switch: under the pump in the drawing, OFF gets a third line, "UNLESS OVERRIDE SWITCH IS ON"; when the screen switches the pump off, on its own or with ALL OFF, the last-event line adds "its override switch can still run it" | Setting and React UI | The HLT pump has a switch on the rig that runs it whatever CraftBeerPi says, and CraftBeerPi can't see that switch (rig record, 9 Oct). So "confirmed off" only means CraftBeerPi switched its output off, not that the pump has stopped. `BREWDAY_OVERRIDE_ACTOR` names the switch with an override; the screen adds both lines for it. The phone has no drawing, so there the last-event line and LOG carry it. |
| Last event and LOG under the title bar | React UI | Covers commands from this screen. Showing commands from the phone on the monitor too needs a shared log: server, optional. |
| Rest timer when brewing by hand: one timer, shared by every screen | Server and React UI | Scott chose this on 9 Nov. The server keeps the time left and whether it is running; START TIMER, PAUSE TIMER and ±5 MIN are commands to it, and every open screen shows the same countdown. At zero the server raises a CraftBeerPi notification, which shows on every screen and stays until answered, as hop alerts have since the S2 fix. |
| Barlow and Barlow Condensed fonts | React UI | Bundle the font files with the UI build. The Pi may have no internet on brew day; the mockup loads them from Google Fonts. |
| An HLT pump in the simulator | Simulator configuration | The rig already has one: `Recirc_PUMP` on GPIO 7, which is also the HLT kettle's agitator (Scott confirmed the pump mapping on 9 Oct). The simulator has `Mash Pump` and `Glycol Pump` but no HLT pump; Brett plans to add one when he builds this. |

## What this screen does not fix

- U5 (a widget is deleted on touch, with no undo) and U6 (the saved fields `heigth` and `pathes` are
  misspelled) live in the free-form dashboard editor. The brew-day screen does not use the editor, so both
  stay open.
- Fermentation is out of scope; the fermenter dashboard (dashboard 2) is untouched.
- Recording the brew day (measurements, notes, saved brew days) belongs to BrewScribe and is not on this
  screen.

## Earlier proposals this settles

- Mockup 07 (does a step timeline replace the step list, or sit beside it?): the recipe stays a list,
  down the left beside the faceplates, with the current step's progress bar in the list.
- Mockup 03 (recipe progress), which Scott liked, carries over into the recipe column.

## Additions beyond the D3 picture: Scott kept all of them

The D3 layout Scott chose does not show these. Each one is in the mockup for a reason. On 9 Nov Scott said
"keep your additions".

- **ALL OFF** in the title bar (ALL HEAT OFF until 9 Nov). Product principle 2: switching off is always
  quick. Neutral outline when nothing is wrong, so red keeps meaning PV digits and faults.
- **CONNECTED dot and the LOG button.** Principle 3 and defect U1: the screen should say whether it is
  live and what happened to each command.
- **Rest timer when no recipe runs.** Scott said on 2 Oct that he uses his phone as a rest timer when
  brewing by hand. Principle 5: brewing by hand is as first-class as brewing from a recipe. Since 9 Nov it
  is one timer shared by every screen.
- **The Recipe Book list** in the same no-recipe moment, so one tap on LOAD gets a recipe ready to start.
- **The step strip at the top of the phone screen**, with the next step under it. The STORY line: "the
  step now and next".
- **A line under each window** ("At target", "0.4 °F below target"): the STORY line, "how close each
  vessel is".
- **The current step shows its time left** ("23:41 LEFT") where D3 shows a ▶ marker, because the time left
  is what you look for from across the garage. Steps still to come keep D3's ring marker.
- D3 shows START / PAUSE / NEXT STEP. CraftBeerPi has no pause (its step commands are start, stop, next
  and reset), so the mockup has START / STOP / NEXT STEP.

## Scott's answers (9 Nov 2026)

1. ALL HEAT OFF: keep it, stop the HLT pump too ("Yes, stop the HLT pump too"), and call it ALL OFF ("Yes,
   call it ALL OFF"). It now stops both pumps, including a wort pump switched on by hand.
2. Rest timer: one timer shared by the monitor and the phone ("Share one timer between screens"), so the
   server keeps it.
3. How the HLT pump is set up on the rig: Brett found the answer in the rig records, so Scott wasn't asked.
   It is its own actor, `Recirc_PUMP` on GPIO 7, and also the HLT kettle's agitator. It has an override
   switch that runs it whatever CraftBeerPi says (`C:\src\personal\cbpi-rig-comms\rig\2026-10-09.md`,
   line 11).

From his test of the built screen on port 8012, also 9 Nov (Brett passed these on):

4. The drawing should show the wort's path to the boil kettle: "before the boil step, I will run the wort
   pump to move wort from mash tun to [boil] kettle. Animation should reflect that path." And, at the hold
   before the boil: "I should be pumping wort from mash tun to boil kettle at this step".
5. "maybe there should be an icon for a valve between the pump and the HERMS coil too?" The drawing now has
   a hand valve on every branch, that one included.
6. When the wort starts going to the boil kettle: "From the start of the Sparge step: I fly sparge, so wort
   runs to the boil kettle during the sparge".
7. Whether the HLT pump moves the sparge water: "Yes, the HLT pump moves the sparge water to the mash tun".
   Before the sparge it recirculates the HLT; Brett's server change starts it whenever the HLT heats.

Assumed at first, answered on 10 Nov: the HLT pump's two ways (back round the HLT, or over to the mash tun)
are drawn with hand valves, like the wort pump's. Scott actually moves hoses, but wants the valves drawn.

The screen isn't waiting on Scott. Two questions about the drawing have been answered but not drawn yet (see
"Open questions about the drawing" below).

## A fix to the screen as built (10 Nov)

When brewing by hand, the recipe column holds the rest timer and the recipe book. On a screen under about
1000 px tall that is taller than the column, so the whole page scrolled: 34 px in a 1920×950 browser window
(Scott's usual set-up) and 131 px on a 1440×900 laptop, breaking the One Screen Rule. Now the recipe book's
list scrolls inside the column, as the step list does while a recipe runs (`.book` and `.book ul` in
`brew-day.css`). Where nothing overflowed, the screen is unchanged, apart from one or two levels of
anti-aliasing on the list's rounded corners, because the list is now a scroll box.

## Boil power: Scott's top priority (10 Nov), ships before the graphs

Scott, 10 Nov: "I seem to have lost the critical ability to set the boil power percentage with this redesign.
Work with the design agent to add it back. This is next high priority." A few minutes later: "I need to be
able to adjust boil element power even while running a recipe".

Brett is releasing this on the screen as built, before the graphs. So the reference is
`brew-day.html?graphs=none#boilpower`; `brew-day.html#boilpower` is the same control with the graphs.

What Scott sees:

- On the boil kettle's faceplate, a button beside the BOIL ELEMENT lamp. The lamp used to fill that row on its
  own; now each takes half, so the faceplate gets no taller.
  - Boil kettle in AUTO: **BOIL POWER 45 %**, with "used from 210.2 °F · change" under it. This is BoilPower's
    `Boil_Power`. The temperature is where BoilPower starts using it: the kettle's target, which the Boil step
    sets to 210.2 °F (see the table).
  - Boil kettle in MANUAL: **POWER 100 %**, with "used by hand · change". This is the element's own level, the
    one it runs at when switched on by hand.
- Tapping it opens an editor in place of the mode row, the same shape as the target editor: −5, −1, the value,
  +1, +5, then SET 40 % and CANCEL. Whole numbers from 0 to 100; the keys stop at 0 and 100. Enter sets,
  Escape cancels, and a second tap on the button closes it. While it is open the button has a blue outline.
- After SET the button says "sending…", then the button, the lamp ("HEATING 40 %") and OUT all show the new
  level, and the last-event line says "Boil power 40 % (was 45 %) · confirmed". When the new level isn't in
  use yet, the event line says when it will be, so an OUT that doesn't move isn't taken for a failure:
  "used from 210.2 °F, full power until then" (AUTO, still heating up) or "used when you switch the element
  on" (MANUAL, element off).
- It works while a recipe runs. During the Boil step the kettle is in AUTO and its element lamp is locked
  ("run by AUTO"), but the power button is a separate button and no step locks it. The demo moment
  `#boilpower` is step 5, the Boil, running, with the 60-minute hop already in, and Scott turning 45 % down to
  40 %. (Test Recipe v5's boil is step 5.)
- With no connection it pauses like every other control.

Decisions I made, from Brett's facts. I showed Scott the first and fourth on 10 Nov (one button for both modes,
and no held press); he hasn't answered yet:

- **One button for both modes**, as Brett suggested: BOIL POWER in AUTO, POWER in MANUAL, and the hint says
  when the level is used. Hardware boil controllers work the same way: their output keys set the boil output
  in boil mode and the element output in manual mode. If Scott would rather set the by-hand level somewhere
  else, only the MANUAL half changes.
- **If the kettle's mode changes while the editor is open** (the Boil step starting, a step stopping), the
  editor closes without sending anything, and the note under the faceplate says "The boil kettle switched to
  AUTO, so the button now sets the boil power. Nothing was changed." Otherwise SET could change the by-hand
  level while the button above it says BOIL POWER.
- **During the "Ready to boil?" hold the button offers POWER (by hand), not BOIL POWER.** Brett asked (10 Nov),
  since the kettle is in MANUAL then. Keep it that way. The button always sets the level the element runs at
  in the kettle's current mode, so it always agrees with the lamp and OUT. If Scott heats the first runnings
  by hand while the wort comes over, POWER is the level that matters. The boil power can be set as soon as
  "Start the boil" switches AUTO on: the kettle then takes minutes to reach 210.2 °F, and the event line says
  "full power until then". Offering BOIL POWER during the hold would make the button's meaning depend on the
  recipe as well as the mode, and would leave no way to turn by-hand heat down. CraftBeerPi itself accepts a
  boil power at any time; the screen just doesn't offer it in MANUAL.
- **No held press for SET.** The Held Heat Rule is about switching heat on. SET changes a level and never
  switches the element on; when it is heating, a held press or AUTO already switched it on. It is already a
  deliberate tap, adjust, SET, and the urgent case, turning a boil-over down, has to be quick. DESIGN.md's
  Held Heat Rule now says so.
- **White digits in the editor**, not green (that means a target) or orange (heating now).
- **The hold temperature is left out** (`set_hold_target`, "Hold a temperature (whirlpool / hop stand)" in
  the old dialog). The Whirlpool step sets and clears it itself. Brett will ask Scott whether he wants it.

| Part | What it needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Which kettle gets the button | React UI | Only a kettle whose logic declares the `set_boil_power` action, read from the logic's actions as the old KettleControl dialog did. On the rig, the boil kettle. |
| BOIL POWER value and hint | React UI | The kettle's `Boil_Power` prop. The temperature in the hint is where BoilPower starts using the boil power, `BoilPower._threshold`: the kettle's target when it has one above 0 (the Boil step sets 210.2 °F), else its `Boil_Threshold` setting, else 99 °C / 210.2 °F. So with a 170 °F target the hint reads "used from 170 °F". It is shown as a plain number: 210.2, or 170 for 170.0. Corrected on 10 Nov: this row said `Boil_Threshold` only. Brett's port already followed the plugin; the mockup's `boilFrom()` now does too. |
| Setting it (AUTO) | React UI | `POST /kettle/{id}/action` with `{"action": "set_boil_power", "parameter": {"Boil_Power": N}}`. Works with the kettle off or on and at any step, and is kept in the kettle's settings, so a step restarting the logic keeps it. BoilPower uses it at its next control decision, about 2 s later, so OUT can lag "confirmed" by up to 2 s. A warning from CraftBeerPi (a value it can't use) is a failure: the button says so and the value stays as it was. |
| POWER value and setting it (MANUAL) | React UI | The element actor's `power`, and `POST /actor/{id}/set_power` with `{"power": N}`. Since M61 this level is the brewer's own and stays put when AUTO stops. |
| The lamp and OUT | React UI | Unchanged: the element's power while it is on. In AUTO below the threshold that is Max_Output (100 %), so OUT reads 100 % while the button reads the boil power. That is right, and the hint says why. |
| Whether a new boil power is in use yet | React UI | BoilPower switches to the boil power when the wort reaches the threshold, and keeps it until the wort falls 3.6 °F (2 °C) below (its boil latch). The screen can't see the latch, so it judges by PV ≥ threshold. Just after a dip below the threshold (a lid opened, a cold addition), the event line may say "full power until then" when the new level is already in use; OUT shows the real power within 2 s. |
| The editor | React UI | The target editor's layout with −5/−1/+1/+5, whole numbers and `inputmode="numeric"` (`.editor.pwr`). In the mockup: `powerHTML`, `editorHTML`, `cmdPwrOpen`, `cmdPwrStep` and `cmdPwrSet`, the `pwr`, `pstep` and `pset` cases in `run()`, the Enter and input handlers, and the `kind` and `what` fields of `st.edit`. The mode-change rule is at the end of the boil kettle's branch of `setMode`. The number box's screen-reader label follows the mode: "New boil power in percent" in AUTO, "New power by hand in percent" in MANUAL (corrected 10 Nov; it said "boil power" in both). |
| Two small fixes that come with it | React UI | (1) While any value editor is open, `#app` gets `data-editing`. Then the other faceplates' button rows stop stretching to the editor's height (the faceplates share row heights), and the drawing may shrink further (to 160 px, or 110 px with the graphs), so a two-line note under an editor can't make the page scroll. Before this, tapping the locked element lamp with the editor open scrolled the page 6–20 px at 1920×950 and 1440×900. With no editor open neither rule applies. (2) A valid SET clears a "Enter a … from … to …" note left from an earlier try, in both editors. |
| The demo moment | Mockup | `#boilpower`. Scenes can now carry `open` (state applied after `load()` resets the editor and notes) and `base` (whose graph history to use). |

Checked in the mockup (Edge), both with `?graphs=none` and with the graphs:

- At 1920×1080, 1920×950, 1440×900 and a 390×844 phone the button fits and its words don't overflow. No
  monitor size scrolls with the editor open, with a warning under it, or with a two-line explanation.
- Walked through: 36 % set mid-boil (lamp, OUT and event follow); 150 refused with "Enter a boil power from 0
  to 100 %."; an unchanged SET just closes; Escape and a second tap close; 60 % set in AUTO while still heating
  up (OUT stays 100 % and the event says when the new level applies); 70 % set in MANUAL with the element off,
  then the element held on (HEATING 70 %), then 55 % while on; NEXT STEP into the Boil with the by-hand editor
  open (it closes, says why, sends nothing); no connection (paused); the boil kettle's target changed to 170 °F
  (the hint follows: "used from 170 °F"). No script errors.
- With no editor open, the six existing moments change only in the boil kettle's lamp row.

### Found while checking: the whirlpool hold (not designed yet)

When the wort in a whirlpool stand cools more than 3.6 °F below the stand's temperature, CraftBeerPi asks
whether to heat it back and hold it there until the stand ends (the core's `WhirlpoolStep`). On "Heat and
hold" it sets BoilPower's `Hold_Target` and switches the kettle's logic on. While a hold is set, BoilPower
doesn't use the boil power at all. More than 7.2 °F below the hold it heats at Max_Output; then it eases off
to `Hold_Power` (30 % by default) as the wort reaches the hold, and switches off at or above it. The Boil step
leaves the kettle's target at 0, so BoilPower also puts its 210.2 °F threshold back as the target, for display
only.

So during a hold, the screen as built shows the boil kettle with SV 210.2 °F, and the line under the window
counts from 210.2 ("44.2 °F below target" at 166 °F), while the kettle is really holding 170 °F. The power
button says "used from 210.2 °F". If Scott set a boil power then, the event line's "full power until then"
would also be wrong. This was true before boil power, apart from the button.

I'll design it with the whirlpool and chiller drawing, which needs a whirlpool moment anyway. My starting
point: the faceplate shows the hold as its SV, MODE reads HOLD, and the line under the window counts from the
hold; the power button says the boil power isn't used during a hold. The screen can tell a hold is set from
the kettle's `Hold_Target` setting: a number above 0 and more than 3.6 °F below the boil point
(`BoilPower._hold_target`). Whether Scott also wants to set a hold from this screen is the question Brett is
keeping for him.

## Open questions about the drawing

Both were answered by Scott on 10 Nov; the drawing hasn't been changed for them yet, and the change will come
to Brett separately, after boil power:

- Valves or hoses: he moves hoses between ports on quick-disconnects, but wants the drawing to keep the
  valves: "I like the valve representation - it is professional looking process control".
- After the boil: the wort pump does not run during the boil. Once the boil is over it runs the boil kettle
  round through the chiller and back into the kettle (an optional whirlpool), and then sends the wort through
  the chiller to the fermenter. Until the drawing has that path, running the wort pump then still shows wort
  going round the HERMS coil into the mash tun, which is wrong.

## Temperature graphs: Scott chose option A on 10 Nov, to be built

Scott asked (9 Nov): "Can you mock up a way to add temperature graphs to the dashboard? It should be natural
looking and not like a bolt-on". Asked what a graph should show at a glance, he answered: "I'd like the
ability to toggle between a,b, and c by clicking the temperature graph". The three were (a) the last 30
minutes, to see whether a vessel will reach its target and roughly when; (b) the last 10 minutes, to see how
steadily it is holding; (c) the whole brew day.

He then chose option A, "graphs always showing, with a smaller rig drawing", over option B, a DRAWING /
GRAPHS switch that would have swapped the drawing for the graphs, and asked for it to go to Brett to build.
Asked how CraftBeerPi shows on his monitor, he said he usually runs a normal browser window with tabs and the
address bar showing, and that full screen "is a good idea and I may start to use that in the future". So A
has to work in a browser window about 950 px tall on his 1080-line monitor, and now does.

How to look at it:

- `brew-day.html` shows the graphs by default; `?graphs=none` shows the screen as first built. `&span=10`,
  `30` or `day` picks the starting span.
- `graphs.html` is the comparison Scott chose from: A, B and the screen without graphs, on a full-screen
  monitor, a browser window on that monitor and a phone. B (`?graphs=panel`) is kept only for that record:
  don't port `renderGraphPanel`, `.gpanel`, `.ghead`, `.gcol`, `.gwin` or `.gview`.
- The code is `graphs.js`, hooks in `brew-day.js` (search for `GRAPHS` and `graph`), the label scale `rs` in
  `rig.js`, and the block at the end of `brew-day.css`. With `?graphs=none` the page matches the screen as
  built pixel for pixel: checked against `design\brewday` in all six moments at 1920×1080, 1440×900 and
  390×844, 18 of 18 identical.

What it is:

- One graph per vessel, in its PID window under the PV and SV, with its own temperature scale. The three
  are never put on one shared plot, which Scott turned down. Red line for PV, green step line for SV, orange
  band for OUT (element power), numbered tags where steps started, clock times along the bottom when the
  graph is at least 90 px tall. The three share their clock marks.
- 10 MIN, 30 MIN and DAY beside each graph. Tapping a graph moves all three to the next span; tapping a
  label goes straight to it. 30 MIN to start with.
- When readings stop, the lines turn grey and a dark stretch covers the time with no readings.
- When a vessel is heading for its target and is at least 1 °F away, its status line adds "about N min at
  this rate", worked out from the last 3 minutes and shown only if it's under 2 hours.
- On a phone the graph sits in each faceplate too, 108 px tall.

What it costs on a monitor, and how the screen makes up for it:

- The drawing gets shorter: 289 px instead of 413 px on a 1920×1080 screen at full screen, and 221 px
  instead of 283 px in a browser window about 950 px tall.
- Its labels are set larger as it shrinks, up to 1.3 times (vessel names up to 1.15 times). In a browser
  window they come out the same size as on the screen as first built.
- When the screen is 1000 px tall or less, the faceplates tighten. The PV and SV keep their size.
  - Faceplate rows 8 px apart instead of 10.
  - Lamp buttons 66 px tall instead of 73 (padding 12px 8px 5px, min-height 58px).
  - The mode row 56 px instead of 64 (min-height 54px).
  - The graph's top margin and padding 7 px instead of 10.
  - The span labels closer together (gap 2 px, padding 4 px).
- The drawing never goes below 140 px. Only a screen under about 900 px tall scrolls, and only a little,
  when an alarm makes the title bar taller.

| Change | What it needs | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| The graphs, the spans, tapping to change span, the grey lines and dark stretch when readings stop, the time-to-target | React UI | `graphs.js` is the reference. Remember the span on each device in `localStorage`; the mockup forgets it when the page reloads. Each graph is drawn to its box, so redraw when the fonts finish loading (the mockup listens for `document.fonts` `loadingdone`) or watch each box with a `ResizeObserver`; otherwise a graph keeps the width it had before the fonts arrived. |
| The faceplates tightening at 1000 px tall or less | React UI | The `@media (min-width:1180px) and (max-height:1000px)` block in `brew-day.css`, all under `[data-graphs=face]`. |
| PV history | React UI on today's server; sharper with a server change | `GET /log/{name}` and `POST /log/logs` return a sensor's whole log thinned to about 500 points (the highest reading in each slice), with no time window. Over a 6-hour log that's a point every 43 s or so: fine for DAY and 30 MIN, coarse for 10 MIN. The screen can start from that and then add the live readings it already receives (`sensorupdate`). A `since` parameter on `/log` would give full detail straight away (server, optional). |
| SV and OUT history | One setting; a server change for heating by hand | The kettle logics log their target and element power only when the `PID_LOGGING` setting is "Yes" (it defaults to "No"): PIDHerms as `<mash tun id>.mash_setpoint`, `.hlt_setpoint` and `.duty`, PIDBoil as `<kettle id>.setpoint` and `.duty`. Nothing is logged while a kettle is in MANUAL, and switching an actor is never logged (`CBpiActor.log_data` exists but nothing calls it). Without server work, the screen can only draw SV and OUT for the time it has been open. |
| Step tags, and where DAY starts | Server, optional | CraftBeerPi doesn't keep the time each step started. The screen can tag the steps it saw start while it was open. To keep them after a reload, and to start DAY when the recipe started, the server would have to keep the start times. BrewScribe may already record them, so ask Scott and Porter before adding a second record. Until then DAY can show the last 8 hours. |
| The drawing's labels set larger when it is shorter | React UI | `rigSVG(style, W, rs)` and `rigPump(…, rs)` in `rig.js`; `drawRig` in `brew-day.js` works out `rs` (at most 1.3). With `rs` = 1 the drawing is unchanged. |

The graphs show the brew day so far only to help Scott run it. They don't save anything; recording the brew
day stays BrewScribe's job.
